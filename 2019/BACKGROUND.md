For personal enrichment in the late 1980's I did take night courses at
a local college in COBOL, ADA, and IBM System 360 Assembler: still all
on a main-frame, batch job.

After retirement from the USAF on 1987-12-31 (after 22.5 years
service), I was able to use my USAF fighter pilot experience along
with my programming experience to get hired with the local Field
Office of Oklahoma State University (OSU-FO, a US Department of
Defense [DoD] contractor) as a Senior Analyst and Branch Chief.

After my youngest child graduated from high school in 1991, I resigned
from OSU-FO and my wife and I rented our home and moved into a small
apartment near Clemson, South Carolina, where I was accepted as a
graduate student in Engineering Mechanics in Clemson
University's Department of Mechanical Engineering.

After two years and having finished all my courses, and with the
approval of Clemson and my thesis committee, I left Clemson to look
for a real job and put my thesis on hold for a while.

I was fortunate to be hired as a Senior Analyst with another local DoD
contractor (who turned out to be my employer for the next 23 years).
I was lucky enough in that last job to be hired as an engineer with
lots of latitude to get the job done.  I was usually under pressure to
complete tasks not directly resulting in software deliveries, but
requiring customized software tools to execute long-running CAD
programs and generate reports summarizing studies of modeling weapons
effects (WE) on various target vehicles. The work involved heavy use
of the US DoD's CAD program [BRL-CAD](https://brlcad.org) (which was
made open-source in 2004). The program as used in typical WE modeling
tasks generates hundreds of thousands of lines of ASCII output which
has to be analyzed and summarized and discussed in detail in published
reports.
